# Japanese Flashcards
This project is designed to create and track 3-sided flashcards for Japanese Kanji.  This project currently does not "run".  
All of the code is run with unit tests in the effort of creating a framework, which can be called by another application.  
This will eventually be dockerized and likely turned into an API + React app.
